# ways of declaring string in python
#single quote way => 'your_string_value'
example0 = 'Solomon is coding.'
print(example0)
#my output will be = Solomon is coding.

#double quote way => "your_string_value"
example01 = "Solomon is coding for real."
print(example01)
#my output will be = Solomon is coding for real.


#if I want to print a program that has double or single quote in them 
#(0) I can either escape them by adding back slash in front of where I want to put the quotes or
#(1) By opening my string with 3 double quote (""") and also ending it with 3 double quote(""")
#This way my string can take any thing with them 
example02 = """Solomon is trying to learn python; and he is learning it "well" and hope he becomes 'good' in it"""
print(example02)
#my output will be = Solomon is trying to learn python; and he is learning it "well" and hope he becomes 'good' in it
